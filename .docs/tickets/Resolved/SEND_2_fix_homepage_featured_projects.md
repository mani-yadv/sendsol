## Description
Enhance the homepage featured projects section with improved user profile management, high-resolution avatars, and better data organization.

## Objectives
1. Create proper user profile management system
2. Implement high-resolution avatar handling
3. Improve project data organization and relationships
4. Enhance UI/UX of featured projects display

## Success Criteria
1. User profiles are properly stored and linked to projects
2. High-resolution avatars are displayed with fallbacks
3. Data updates in real-time when new transactions occur
4. Loading states are shown while data is being fetched
5. Error states are handled gracefully

## Resolution
All planned features have been successfully implemented and tested:
- User profiles table created with proper data sync
- High-resolution avatars with fallback handling
- Improved UI with verification badges and clickable profiles
- Optimized database queries and frontend performance
- Comprehensive documentation added

## Changes Implemented

### Database Optimizations
1. Created `user_profiles` table to store user data:
   - Added fields: username, avatar_url, avatar_url_original, verified, name, x_profile_url
   - Implemented automatic sync with auth.users metadata
   - Added foreign key relationship with projects table

2. Query Optimizations:
   - Single query for projects with transactions and user profiles
   - Added sorting by created_at date (descending)
   - Improved avatar URL handling with high-resolution images

### UI Improvements
1. Featured Projects Display:
   - Added creator profile images with fallback icon
   - Implemented clickable avatars that open X profiles in new tab
   - Added verification badge for verified creators
   - Updated amount formatting to show "0 SOL" for zero amounts

2. Visual Updates:
   - Replaced lightning icon with user avatars
   - Added Phosphor icons for better visual consistency
   - Improved layout and spacing
   - Added proper hover states and cursor indicators

## Implementation Details

### Database Design Decisions
```sql
-- Key decisions in user_profiles table:
-- 1. Store both original and processed avatar URLs
--    - avatar_url: High-res processed version
--    - avatar_url_original: Original URL as backup
--    This provides fallback if processing fails and future flexibility

-- 2. URL Processing Function
create or replace function process_avatar_url(url text)
-- Handles multiple cases:
-- - Twitter/X normal size (_normal.jpg)
-- - Other known sizes (_mini, _bigger, etc)
-- - Non-Twitter URLs
-- - Null values
```

### Avatar URL Processing Strategy
```javascript
// Store side handling:
creator_image: project.user_profiles?.avatar_url || project.user_profiles?.avatar_url_original

// Benefits:
// 1. Automatic fallback to original URL if processed URL fails
// 2. No need for complex client-side logic
// 3. Single source of truth in database
```

### UI Component Structure
```vue
<!-- FeaturedProjectsItem.vue -->
<!-- Key features: -->
<!-- 1. Conditional rendering for verification badge -->
<PhosphorIconCheckCircle v-if="project.creator_verified" />

<!-- 2. Avatar with fallback -->
<img v-if="project.creator_image" :src="project.creator_image" />
<PhosphorIconUser v-else size="24" />

<!-- 3. Profile link handling -->
@click="handleCreatorClick"
```

### Migration Strategy
1. Two-step migration process:
   ```sql
   -- Step 1: Create user_profiles (20250209114317)
   -- Ensures clean table creation with all fields
   
   -- Step 2: Add FK constraint (20250209114318)
   -- Separates structure from relationships
   -- Easier rollback if needed
   ```

2. Data synchronization:
   - Automatic sync on user creation/update
   - One-time migration for existing users
   - Preserves all metadata from auth.users

### Performance Considerations
1. Database:
   - Single join query instead of multiple queries
   - Indexed foreign key relationships
   - Efficient URL processing at database level

2. Frontend:
   - Minimal state management
   - Efficient re-renders
   - Proper image loading with fallbacks

### Security Measures
1. RLS Policies:
   ```sql
   -- Public read access for profiles
   create policy "Public profiles are viewable by everyone"
     on user_profiles for select using ( true );
   
   -- Restricted write access
   create policy "Users can update own profile"
     on user_profiles for update using ( auth.uid() = id );
   ```

2. URL Processing:
   - Safe URL manipulation with regex
   - No external API calls required
   - Preserved original URLs for verification
